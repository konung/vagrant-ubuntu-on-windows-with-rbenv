# Vagrant: Ubuntu guest with rbenv and all libs required to compile most popular ruby gems.


Read comments  especially in vagrant_config/ & Vagrantfile.

This will work on any host machine  - Mac, Linux or Windows (winnfs is only for windows - just comment it out)

Stuff needed to run on Windows host is commented out - it's just using NFS for storage sharing - much faster, thank buiilt-in stuff in VritualBox. Not needed on OSX or Linux
